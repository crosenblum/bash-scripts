bash-scripts
============

This is a group of different bash scripts that I work with use, create or have gotten from other people.

Some of these scripts other people have written, and I take no claim for them. 

Other than the fact that they are useful and solve problems I have.

One of my main projects is creating bash scripts related to managing your downloaded movies. 
I want to make it easy for it to correctly rename your folders & files, download posters&fanart, download subtitles.
All in all to help deliver quality content with your movies, so then you can use any media center app or any video player 
to play them as you wish.

I am a huge fan of automation, and since I have migrated to Linux, this is what I have been using bash for.
